# In the realm of code, where worlds collide,
A tale of Space Oddity, I shall confide.
Major Tom, a figure, floating through the void,
With PHP as the language, his story employed.

Through lines of code, a spacecraft did ascend,
As Major Tom embarked on a cosmic trend.
PHP, the engine, powering his flight,
Guiding him through the vast expanse of the night.

In digital realms, where dreams intertwine,
PHP weaves a tapestry, sublime.
With syntax and functions, it constructs a way,
For Major Tom's odyssey, day by day.

In PHP, there are several built-in data types you can use. Here is a list of commonly used data types in PHP:

Integer: Represents whole numbers, e.g., 1, 100, -50.

Float/Double: Represents floating-point numbers, e.g., 3.14, -2.5.

String: Represents a sequence of characters, enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").

Boolean: Represents either true or false.

Array: Represents an ordered collection of elements, where each element can be of any data type.

Object: Represents an instance of a class, which can have properties and methods.

Null: Represents a variable with no value assigned to it.

Resource: Represents a reference to an external resource, such as a database connection.

Callable: Represents a variable that can be called as a function or method.

Iterable (as of PHP 7.1): Represents objects that can be iterated over, such as arrays and classes implementing the Iterator interface.

Additionally, PHP 7 introduced some additional data types related to handling errors and type declarations:

Closure: Represents an anonymous function.

Generator: Represents a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over a set of values without needing to store them all in memory.

Throwable: Represents any object that can be thrown as an exception.
