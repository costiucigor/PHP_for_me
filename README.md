# In the realm of code, where worlds collide,
A tale of Space Oddity, I shall confide.
Major Tom, a figure, floating through the void,
With PHP as the language, his story employed.

Through lines of code, a spacecraft did ascend,
As Major Tom embarked on a cosmic trend.
PHP, the engine, powering his flight,
Guiding him through the vast expanse of the night.

In digital realms, where dreams intertwine,
PHP weaves a tapestry, sublime.
With syntax and functions, it constructs a way,
For Major Tom's odyssey, day by day.
